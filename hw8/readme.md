This week was quite challenging and time consuming. I felt that i had to get everything precise and it was a challenge to get things in the right place and to see what i need to make things work. I couldnt get my live site to work but i was only worried that my codes logic is off. I found myself going over previous sources for this info and tried to make the best of it. I felt my main logic was right but seeing what needed to be where gave me aa headache.
