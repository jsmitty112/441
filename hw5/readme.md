#Readme or else
---
This week i didnt struggle as much as last week. I had many useful sources to help me on my way. I was able to see the bigger picture of my code and what it can do. I found myself going back to the website and following the videos. I did pretty well for the most part and i feel comfortable moving forward with this game.
